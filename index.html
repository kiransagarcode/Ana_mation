   <p>My name is Neha Johny — I am a digital artist, animator, and dancer from India.</p>

<p class="my-4">I love designing logos, creating digital paintings, pencil sketches, and building environments for cartoon-based 2D animations. I’m also trying to master 3D modeling.</p>

<p>Most of my creative work is inspired by my own experiences, the stories I’ve lived, and the emotions I’ve felt. I believe it's easier to communicate with the world through art rather than words. For me, art is how I express my feelings.</p>

<p class="my-4">One of my TV series ideas, Mariyam and Her Shoe Tales, is based on my own story. When I migrated from India, I didn’t have anyone around to talk to. So, I started speaking to things in my room, imagining them as living beings that could respond to me. That’s how the plot for Mariyam and Her Shoes came to life.</p>

<p>I truly believe that art is the best way to connect with people. To me, it’s more than just a profession — it’s a powerful way of expressing who I am.</p>

    <h1>ANA </h1>
  </div>
  
  <div class="para">
   <p>My final project, titled ANA, tells the story of a girl struggling with her insecurities and past traumas. Once a social butterfly, she now avoids crowds and even the people she used to love being around. The film explores her emotional journey after an incident that changed everything.</p>

<p class="my-4">The people she trusted turned away when she needed them most, leaving her to blame herself. She feels like even if she screams for help, no one would hear her. That silence becomes her reality.</p>

<p>The story takes place in her home—her only safe space—where she begins to revisit memories from her past. Through these reflections, the film reveals the pain of being unheard and the confusion of not knowing what to do next.</p>

<p class="my-4">ANA is a personal and emotional look at how trauma can isolate someone and how the mind holds onto moments that shape who we become.</p>
